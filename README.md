## Ranking Hubs and Authorities Using Matrix Functions

The main project for the course: Matrix Methods and Tools in Data Science <br>


I run some experiments on a variety of Graphs to test the hypotheses presented in the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.3120<br>

Detailed results and explanations are given in the report Petrakis_Konstantinos_1041589.pdf
